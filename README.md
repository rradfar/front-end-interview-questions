🌼 Arrays: concat(): 2 special notes  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

1. It returns a newly constructed array. The original array remains **unchanged**.
2. The `concat()` method **flattens** the result.

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
let colors2 = colors.concat("yellow", ["black", "brown"]);
console.log(colors); // ["red", "green","blue"]
console.log(colors2); // ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "black", "brown"]
```

🌼 Arrays: 2 ways to create a new array  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- By using the Array constructor

```javascript
let colors = new Array();
let colors = new Array(20);
let colors = new Array("red", "blue", "green");
```

- By using array literal notation

```javascript
let names = [];
let values = [1,2,];
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: 3 ways to clone an array & why we don't use array1 = array2  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

```javascript
const newArray = originalArray.slice();
const newArray = [...originalArray];
const newArray = Array.from(originalArray);
```

- If we use the equal sign, the second array will point to the same memory location as the original array (shallow copying), so any changes to the second array will be reflected in the original array as well and vice versa.

```javascript
let a = [1, 2];
let b = a;

a.push(3);
console.log(b); // [1, 2, 3]

b.push(4);
console.log(a); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: create an array with an initial length of 20  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

```javascript
let arr = new Array(20);
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: every() vs. some()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- The `every()` method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- The `some()` method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
[12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(x => x >= 10); // false
[12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(x => x >= 10); // true​
[2, 5, 8, 1, 4].some(x => x > 10); // false
[12, 5, 8, 1, 4].some(x => x > 10); // true
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: fill()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- The fill() method changes all elements in an array to a static value.
- fill() is a mutator method: it will change the original array and return it, not a copy of it.

```markdown
arr.fill(value, start(optional), end(optional))
```

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(array1.fill(0, 2, 4)); //=> [1, 2, 0, 0]
console.log(array1.fill(5, 1)); //=> [1, 5, 5, 5]
console.log(array1.fill(6)); //=> [6, 6, 6, 6]
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: flat()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- It is used to flatten an array.
- It can receive an optional depth level parameter specifying how deep a nested array structure should be flattened. Defaults to 1.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
arr1.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4]

let arr2 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
arr2.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]

let arr3 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
arr3.flat(2); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

let arr4 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, 10]]]]];
arr4.flat(Infinity); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

- It can also used to remove empty slots in an array.

```javascript
let arr5 = [1, 2, , , 4, 5];
arr5.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: flat() vs. flatmap()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- `flat()` is simply used to flatten an array.
- `flatmap()` is the combination of the `map()` method followed by the `flat()` method to a  depth of 1.

```javascript
let sentences = ["JavaScript Array flatMap()", " ", "is", " ", "Awesome"];
let words = sentences.flatMap(s => s.split(' '));
console.log(words);
// [ 'JavaScript', 'Array', 'flatMap()', '', '', 'is', '', '', 'Awesome' ]
```

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: forEach() vs. map()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- The `forEach()` method doesn't return anything (`undefined`). It simply calls a provided function on each element in the array. This callback is allowed to mutate the calling array.
- The `map()` method also calls a provided function on every element in the array. The difference is that `map()` utilizes return values and actually returns a new Array of the same size.

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: from()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- `Array.from()` creates a new array instance from an array-like or iterable object.
- It has an optional map parameter, which allows us to execute a `map()` function on each element of the array being created.

```javascript
function f() {
  return Array.from(arguments);
}
console.log(f(1, 2, 3));  // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

🌼 Arrays: the three methods used to perform a search in an array?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- ECMAScript’s three strict equivalence lookup methods are `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`, available in all ECMAScript versions, and `includes()`, which was introduced in the ECMAScript 7 specification.

</p></details>

🌼 Arrays: why is it Not recommended to use `for.. in` loops to iterate over an array.  
expressions  
🌼 Async & Await  
🌼 Atomics  
🌼 Bitwise operators  
🌼 BOM (Browser Object Model)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser.
- Unlike the DOM, there is no standard for implementation and no strict definition, so browser vendors are free to implement the BOM in any way they wish.
- The top level of the hierarchy is the window object which represents the browser window.

🌱 Compiling vs. Transpiling  
🌼 console.log() vs. console.dir()  
🌼 Currying  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.
- For instance it can make function `f(a,b,c)` callable as `f(a)(b)(c)`.

For example,

```javascript
function multiply(a, b, c) {
  return a * b * c;
}
multiply(1,2,3); // 6
```

can be modified to its curried version as such:

```javascript
function multiply(a) {
  return (b) => {
    return (c) => {
      return a * b * c;
    }
  }
}
multiply(1)(2)(3); // 6
```

🌼 Event handling: delegation  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- DOM event delegation is a mechanism of responding to UI events via a single common parent rather than each child.
- It is a technique for listening to events where we can delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.

</p></details>

🌼 Event handling: bubbling vs. capturing  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- In bubbling mode, which is the default mode, the event will be triggered at the deepest element. Then it will be bubbled up to the its parents. In other words, if an event occurs on a given element, it will be triggered on its parent as well and on its parent’s parent and all the way up, until the html element.
- In capturing mode, the order is opposite. The handler will be invoked from the parent element first, then down to the its children. We can force the event to be fired in the capturing mode by passing the third parameter of addEventListener(event, handler, useCapture) to true.

</p></details>

🌱 Event handling: propagation  
🌼 Event handling: propagation: the three phases of event propagation.  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

1. Capture phase — Starting from window, document and the root element, the event dives down through ancestors of the target element
2. Target phase — The event gets triggered on the element on which the user has clicked
3. Bubble phase — Finally, the event bubbles up through ancestors of the target element until the root element, document, and window.

🌼 Falsy values

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.
- There are 8 falsy values: `false`, `0`, `-0`, `0n` (BigInt), `' '` (Empty string), `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.

</p></details>

🌱 Feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string  
🌼 for.. in vs. for.. of  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `for.. in` iterates over all enumerable property **keys** of an object
- `for.. of` iterates over the **values** of an iterable object.

```javascript
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let key in arr) {
  console.log(key); //=> 0, 1, 2
}

for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value) //=> a, b, c
}
```

</p></details>

🌼 Functions vs. methods  
🌼 Functions: `arguments` object  
🌼 Functions: arrow functions vs. classic functions (4 differences)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
1. An arrow function does not have its own this. In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever. With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function (lexical).
2. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error when used with new.
3. Unlike regular functions, the `arguments` object is not defined for arrow functions.
4. Arrow functions do not have a prototype property.

</p></details>

🌱 Functions: `function Person(){}` vs. `var person = Person()` vs. `var person = new Person()`  
🌼 Functions: higher order functions  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Higher order functions take another function as an argument or return a function.
- Taking another function as an argument is often referred to as a callback function

</p></details>

🌼 Functions: idempotent functions  
🌼 Functions: pure functions  
🌼 Functions: why do we say that in JavaScript, functions are first class citizens.  
🌼 Generator functions & yield keyword  
🌼 Generators  
🌼 Getters & Setters  
🌼 Hoisting  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
  
- It allows us to use a variable before it has been declared.

- Hoisted variables are initialized to `undefined` until they are assigned a value.

- Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

- Function and Class **expressions** are not hoisted.

```javascript
console.log(a); //=> undefined
var a = 1;

console.log(b);
let b = 1;
// "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
```

🌼 JSON parse() vs. stringify()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `JSON.parse()` takes a JSON string and transforms it into a JavaScript object.
- `JSON.stringify()` takes a JavaScript object and transforms it into a JSON string.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 23,
  favoriteFood: 'Pizza'
};

const objStr = JSON.stringify(obj);

console.log(objStr);
// "{"name":"John","age":23,"favoriteFood":"Pizza"}"

console.log(JSON.parse(objStr));
// Object {name:"John",age:23,favoriteFood:"Pizza"}
```

</p></details>

🌼 let vs. const (2 differences)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

1. Unlike `let`, variables declared with `const`  cannot be reassigned a new value since `const` defines a constant reference to a value.
2. Unlike `let`, variables declared with `const` must be assigned a value as soon as they are declared.  

</p></details>

🌼 let vs. var (3 differences)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
1. `let` is block-scoped whereas `var` is function-scoped.
2. Variables declared with `let` are not hoisted whereas variables declared with `var` are hoisted.
3. Variables declared with `let` cannot be re-declared whereas variables declared with `var` can.

🌱 NaN: where would be a situation in which you would see `NaN`. How to check for NaN?  
🌼 null vs. undefined (3 differences)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

1. `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. `null` on the other hand can be assigned to a variable as an intentional representation of no value or empty value.
2. In arithmetic, `undefined` is treated as `NaN` whereas `null` is treated as zero.
3. `undefined` is not valid in JSON whereas `null` is.

</p></details>

🌼 null == undefined? How about null === undefined?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```javascript
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
```

- `undefined` and `null` are two distinct types: `undefined` is a type itself while `null` is an object.

</p></details>

🌼 Null: how to check if something is null? How about undefined?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Since `null == undefined` we could simply check if `variable == null` or `variable == null`.
- We can also use `typeof variable === 'undefined'` to check if a variable is `undefined`. The same cannot be done for `null` since `typeof null` is object.

</p></details>

🌼 Null: what does `typeof null` return?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```javascript
typeof null === 'object'; // true
```

</p></details>

🌱 Nullish coalescing operator  
🌼 Objects: assign()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };
const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); //=> Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
console.log(returnedTarget); //=> Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: assign() - A problem with using it to copy objects  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Object.assign() only does shallow copying. For deep cloning, we need to use alternatives. A common hack is to use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` as such:

```javascript
  obj1 = { a: 0 , b: { c: 0}};
  let obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj2)); //=> { "a": 0, "b": { "c": 0}}

  obj1.a = 4;
  obj1.b.c = 4;
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj2)); //=> { "a": 0, "b": { "c": 0}}
  ```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: cloning an object (two ways)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Both of these methods perform shallow cloning:


```javascript
const obj = {a: 1};

const copy1 = Object.assign({}, obj) ;
console.log(copy1); //=> {a: 1}

const copy2 = {...obj} ;
console.log(copy2); //=> {a: 1}
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: create()  
🌼 Objects: creation & initialization (two ways)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- There are two ways to explicitly create an instance of Object.
- The first is to use the new operator with the Object constructor like this:

```javascript
let person = new Object();
person.name = "Nicholas";
person.age = 29;
```

- The other way is to use object literal notation:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Nicholas",
  age: 29
};
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: entries()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
- The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 'something',
  b: 42,
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
//=> [['a', 'something'], ['b', 42]]

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
//=> a: something, b: 42
}
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: freeze()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `Object.freeze()` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 42
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 33;
console.log(obj.prop); //=> 42
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: freeze() vs. seal()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `Object.freeze()` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object.
- `Object.seal()` is similar, however it does allow exiting properties to be modified.

</p></details>

🌱 Objects: freeze() vs. preventExtensions()  
🌼 Objects: fromEntries()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The `Object.fromEntries()` method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object. It accepts an iterable such as Array or Map and returns a new iterable object.

```javascript
const map = new Map([ ['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 42] ]);
const obj = Object.fromEntries(map);
console.log(obj); //=> { foo: "bar", baz: 42 }

const arr = [ ['0', 'a'], ['1', 'b'], ['2', 'c'] ];
const obj = Object.fromEntries(arr);
console.log(obj); // { 0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c" }
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: hasOwnProperty()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The `Object.hasOwnProperty()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).

```javascript
obj = new Object();
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')); // false
obj.prop = 'exists';
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')); // true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')); // false
```

</p></details>

🌱 Objects: host objects vs. native objects  
🌼 Objects: how do we determine if an object is an array?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- By using the `Array.isArray()` method.

```javascript
if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
  // do something on the array
}
```

</p></details>

🌱 Objects: immutable objects  
🌱 Objects: is everything in JavaScript considered an object?  
🌱 Objects: is()  
🌼 Objects: iterating over object properties  
🌼 Objects: the optional chaining operator `?.`

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The optional chaining operator `?.` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.  
- The `?.` operator functions similarly to the `.` chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (`null` or `undefined`), the expression short-circuits with a return value of `undefined`. When used with function calls, it returns `undefined` if the given function does not exist.

```javascript
const adventurer = {
name: 'Alice',
cat: {
  name: 'Dinah'
}
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName); //=> undefined
```

</p></details>

🌼 Objects: the two ways to access an object's properties and their differences  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation.
- With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name.
- When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

```javascript
const colorConfig = {
  red: true,
  blue: false,
  green: true,
  black: true,
  yellow: false,
};

const colors = ['pink', 'red', 'blue'];
console.log(colorConfig.colors[1]); //=> TypeError (colorConfig does not have a colors property.)
```

🌱 Passing by value vs. Passing by reference  
🌼 Primitive data types  
🌱 Promises  
🌼 Prototypal inheritance  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- Each object in JavaScript has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.
- Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer function.

🌼 Shallow vs. Deep copying  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In shallow copying, both items point to the same memory location.
- In deep copying, the second item is assigned a separate memory location than the original item.
- In other words, in a shallow copy, object B points to object A's location in memory. In deep copy, all things in object A's memory location get copied to object B's memory location.

🌼 Strings: padStart() and padEnd()  
🌼 Strings: indexOf() vs. search()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `indexOf()` is for searching for plain substrings. It also allows us to specify a starting index. It does not allow for regular expressions.
- `search()` allows for substrings as well as regular expressions. It does not allow for a starting index.

```javascript
console.log('Blue Whale'.indexOf('Whale', 3)); //=> 5
console.log('hey JudE'.search(/[A-Z]/g)); //=> 4
```

</p></details>

🌼 Strings: search() vs. match()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `Search()` returns the index of the first match between the regular expression and the given string, or `-1` if no match was found.
- `Match()` returns an array or `null` if no matches are found.

```javascript
const str1 = 'hey JudE';
console.log(str1.search(/[A-Z]/g)); // 4

const str2 = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
console.log(str2.match(/[A-E]/gi)); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

<p>

- The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.
- The possible return values are: `object`, `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `string`, `symbol`, `function`, `undefined`.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 3.14); //=> number
console.log(typeof NaN); //=> number
console.log(typeof 42n); //=> bigint
console.log(typeof 'hello'); //=> string
console.log(typeof true); //=> boolean
console.log(typeof Symbol('foo')); //=> symbol
console.log(typeof someVariable); //=> undefined
console.log(typeof [1, 2]); //=> object
console.log(typeof { a: 1 }); //=> object
console.log(typeof null); //=> object

🌼 Unary operators: what is `~3` equal to?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The bitwise Not operator `~` converts the integer `N` to `-(N+1)` value. Therefore `~3 = -4`.

</p></details>

🌼 Unary operators: what is `~~3.9` equal to?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Double bitwise NOT performs the same operation as the `Math.floor()` method but a lot quicker.

```javascript
~~3.9 === Math.floor(3.9); //true, 3
~~2.4 === Math.floor(2.4); //true, 2
~~2 === Math.floor(2); //true, 2

🌼 DOM: getElement(s)By* vs. querySelector(All) methods

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- All `getElement(s)By*` methods return a live HTML collection of elements. Such collections always reflect the current state of the document and auto-update when it changes.
- In contrast, `querySelector(All)` methods return a static NodeList object. It’s like a fixed array of elements. Because querySelectorAll() returns a list that is static from the moment it is called, its list of items cannot be updated thereafter even if changes are made to the DOM dynamically.

```javascript
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
</script>

<div>Second div</div>

<script>
  alert(divs.length); //=> 2
</script>
```

```javascript
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```css
box-shadow: (offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius(optional) | spread-radius(optional) | color(optional));
```

- `blur radius`: if set to 0 the shadow will be sharp, the higher the number, the more blurred it will be, and the further out the shadow will extend.
- `spread radius`: positive values increase the size of the shadow, negative values decrease the size. Default is 0 (the shadow is same size as blur).

```css
/* offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: 60px -16px teal;

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */
box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px black;

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color */
box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

/* inset | offset-x | offset-y | color */

🌼 Box-sizing  
🌼 Cascading in CSS  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Cascading is the process of combining several style sheets and resolving conflicts between them.
- The rule used is chosen by cascading down from the more general rules to the specific rule required.
- Concepts such as **inheritance** and **specificity** are used to decide which styles get applied.  

For instance,  

- a more specific rule will override a less specific rule.
- a rule defined in an external stylesheet is overruled by a style defined in the `<head>` of the document, which, in turn, is overruled by an inline style within the element itself.

🌼 Prefixes  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- CSS vendor prefixes, also sometimes known as or CSS browser prefixes, are a way for browser makers to add support for new CSS features before those features are fully supported in all browsers. This may be done during a sort of testing and experimentation period where the browser manufacturer is determining exactly how these new CSS features will be implemented. These prefixes became very popular with the rise of CSS3 a few years ago.
- The CSS browser prefixes that you can use (each of which is specific to a different browser) are:

```markdown
Android: -webkit-
Chrome: -webkit-
iOS: -webkit-
Safari: -webkit-
Firefox: -moz-
Internet Explorer: -ms-
Opera: -o-
```

```css
.container {
  -webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
  -moz-transition: all 4s ease;

🌼 Pseudo-classes vs pseudo-elements  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
- A pseudo-class is a selector that selects existing elements that are in a specific state, e.g. hovered over, checked, focused, etc.
- Pseudo-classes start with a colon `:`
- Some common pseudo-classes are `:active`, `:checked`, `:enabled`, `:first-child`, `:first-of-type`, `:focus`, `:hover`, `:last-child`, `:last-of-type`, `:nth-of-type`, `:visited`, etc.

```css
article a:hover {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

- Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way, however they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
- Pseudo-elements start with a double colon `::`
- Most common pseudo-elements are `::after`, `::before`, `::first-letter`, and `::first-line`.

```css
article p::first-line {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;

🌼 data-* attributes  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The data-* attributes allow us to be able to make up our own HTML attributes and put our own information inside them.
- They are used to store custom data private to the page or application.
- The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).

```html
<article
  id="electric-cars"
  data-columns="3"
  data-index-number="12314"
  data-parent="cars">
  <!-- additional content -->
</article>
```

- We can read the value of these attributes in JavaScript.

```javascript
const article = document.querySelector('#electric-cars');

article.dataset.columns // "3"
article.dataset.indexNumber // "12314"
article.dataset.parent // "cars"
```

- They can also be accessed in CSS.

```css
article[data-columns='3'] {
  width: 400px;
}
article[data-columns='4'] {
  width: 600px;
}

- The `map` tag is used to define a client-side image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.
- The required name attribute of the `map` element is associated with the `usemap` attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.
- The `map` element contains a number of `area` elements that define the clickable areas in the image map.
- We use the `area` tag in conjunction with the shape of the clickable area [rect, circle, or poly] and coords [rect: left, top, right, bottom; circle: center-x, center-y, radius; poly: x1, y1, x2, y2, ...] attributes.

```html

</p></details>

🌱 REST vs. SOAP APIs  
🌼 RESTful API (6 constraints)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In order to be a true RESTful API, a web service must adhere to the following six REST architectural constraints:
  
1. **Client-Server based**:  
The client and the server should be separate from each other and allowed to evolve individually and independently.
2. **Use of a uniform interface (UI)**:  
The key to the decoupling client from server is having a uniform interface that allows independent evolution of the application without having the application’s services, models, or actions tightly coupled to the API layer itself. The uniform interface lets the client talk to the server in a single language, independent of the architectural backend of either.
3. **Stateless operations**:  
Meaning that requests can be made independently of one another, and each request contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully. A REST API should not rely on data being stored on the server or sessions to determine what to do with a request, but rather solely rely on the data that is provided in that request itself. Identifying information is not being stored on the server when making requests. Instead, each request has the necessary data in itself, such as the API key, access token, user ID, etc.
4. **Caching**:  
A REST API should be designed to encourage the storage of cacheable data on the client side in order to reduce the number of interactions with the API. This means that when data is cacheable, the response should indicate that the data can be stored up to a certain time (expires-at), or in cases where data needs to be real-time, that the response should not be cached by the client.
5. **Layered system**:  
REST allows for an architecture composed of multiple layers of servers. The requesting client need not know whether it’s communicating with the actual server, a proxy, or any other intermediary.
6. **Code on demand (optional)**:  
Most of the time, a server will send back static representations of resources in the form of XML or JSON. However, when necessary, servers can send executable code to the client.
